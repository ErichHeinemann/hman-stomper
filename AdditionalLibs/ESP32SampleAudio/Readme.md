This is a unusual fork of the ESP8266Audio-Library made by Earle Phil Hower

I have used his library which is a great library to build a Mediaplay to start developing a "Sampleplayer". 
After creating some classes for the ESP32 and playing around with his initially created code for the ESP8266 
I had many issues because he also went over to implement compatibility for the ESP32 which is great. 

.. but it I was not able to make steps forward with my project in parallel.

So far, for now, I have a lot of problems with the ESP32 and SD-Card-Modules.
For a few days it worked by 100% but stopped working last weekend. ... I have around 10 boards and 4 tested with 3 SD 
Card Readers and  3 Micro-SD Card .. and they work only in 5% for now.

Perhaps I move over to another paltform, to ESP8266 or Teensy or I drop this project for now.

To get around with using the libraries created by Phil and the Libraries created by me, I have added the word "Sample" 
in front of alle Classes which I have created and lent from Phil.
Finally the Copyright-Comment is not right by 100% because Phils libraries do not have the trailing word "Sample".
