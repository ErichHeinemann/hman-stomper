# hman-stomper - Additional Libraries

Hi all, these libs ware only a temporary solution to add some new functions to the ESP8266-Audio-Library which works with ESP32 too.
I had started to migrated as an extra library end of december and the maintainer of the library has started too in January.

Please follow the maintainer Earle Phil Hower. I will migrate and drop my one.
These files are only temporarily.
