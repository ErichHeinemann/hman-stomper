/*
  AudioMixerOutBuffer
  Adds additional bufferspace and a Mixer-Master-Out to the Mixer 
  
  Like in the real world with the electronic equipment from musicians or a DJ, 
  the DJ defines the Audio-Filesource, ... from SD-Card. .. 
  The File could be a WAV-File and should be played from WAV-Player (Generator)
  The Player is connected to an Input-Channel to the Mixer
  Internally the Input-Channel of the Mixer is connected to an Output-Cahnnel and finally into an Amplifier.
  
  Example-Flow could be:
  - multiple different AudioFileSourceSD
  - are mapped 1:1 to multiple AudioGeneratorWAV - Instances
  - each GeneratorWAV is dynamically or statically mapped to an AudioMixerInBuffer
  - All AudioMixerInBuffers are mapped to one main AudioMixerOutBuffer
  - AudioMixerOutBuffer is finally mapped to AudioOutputI2CDac
  
  AudioMixerInBuffer is less or more a very simple Mixer-Channel
  AudioMixerOutBuffer is comperable to the Mixer-Master-Channel
  
  Currently no Volume, Gain or EQ-Functions are implemented. It is only implemented to mix up to 16 samples in theory into one sample
